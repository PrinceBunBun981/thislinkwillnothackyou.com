            <h1>Safety Tips for Links</h1>
            <p>This link is safe, but others may not be. Here are some tips to help you stay secure when navigating online:</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>1. HTTP vs. HTTPS</h2>
            <p>Always make sure links start with <strong>HTTPS</strong>. The "S" stands for <strong>Secure</strong>, meaning your data is encrypted during transmission. You can learn more about HTTP vs. HTTPS from Cloudflare's learning page: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/" target="_blank" title="Why is HTTP not secure? | HTTP vs. HTTPS | Cloudflare">Why is HTTP not secure?</a></p>
            <p>There are some cases where you may need to use <strong>HTTP</strong> instead of <strong>HTTPS</strong> though, so be careful if it asks you to log in or submit sensitive information.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>https://securewebsite.com</code> vs. <code>http://unsecurewebsite.com</code></p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>2. Masked Links</h2>
            <p>Links that are on some websites won't always show the full URL and are often masked, so make sure it leads to the right place. You can often hover over a link to see the full URL, typically shown in the bottom left of your browser.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href="https://example.com" title="Hover to check the real URL">Click Me!</a> might seem safe, but always verify. (p.s., that link goes to <code>example.com</code>)</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>3. Look-Alike Links</h2>
            <p>Be careful when clicking on links that look similar to real websites. Domains can be purchased by anyone and can sometimes look almost identical to real websites.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>mlcrosoft.com</code> instead of <code>microsoft.com</code>. Notice how the domain looks the same, but it actually uses a lowercase "L" instead of the "i" in Microsoft.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>4. Phishing Attempts</h2>
            <p>Phishing involves attackers creating fake websites to steal your information. They often use emails that appear to come from trusted sources. Always verify the sender's email and the URL before clicking any links that are sent to you.</p>
            <p>Sometimes phishing attempts come from people you trust who have fallen for a phishing scam, be sure to check and make sure that URLs or files sent to you are safe to click on or download.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>5. Use URL Scanners</h2>
            <p>If you're unsure about a link, use an online URL scanner like <a href="https://www.virustotal.com" target="_blank" title="VirusTotal">VirusTotal</a> to check and see if a URL is safe to click on.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you are trying to verify a link that is masked, you can right-click it and choose "Copy link address" in most browsers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>6. Keep Security Software Updated</h2>
            <p>Utilize antivirus software and keep it up to date to defend against malware. Most browsers come with security features to help protect you from unsafe links. You can also utlize Ad-Blocking extensions to block unwanted ads that may lead to unsafe links.</p>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>7. Beware of Fake Ads</h2>
            <p>Be cautious of ads claiming that you've won something like a free phone or suggesting your device is infected. These are often scams that will try to trick you into downloading malicious software or inputting sensitive information somewhere.</p>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>8. Trust Your Instincts</h2>
            <p>If something seems too good to be true, it probably is - that is the sad truth, so trust your instincts, verify that a link is safe before clicking.</p>
